# RemoveTheCubes
---
[**The game "RemoveTheCubes"**](https://kraftpy.github.io/RemoveTheCubes/) is a game in which the main goal is to remove as many cubes as possible in the allotted time.   

For each removed cube, points are awarded. The smaller the cube, the more points. After removing a cube from the field, from 0 to 2 new cubes appear in random order.   

Also, with a 10% probability, instead of the usual cube, a "temporary" cube may appear. These cubes appear for the time allotted to them, after which the cube disappears from the field. If you remove the "temporary" cube, then the time that remained before it disappears is added to the game time.
